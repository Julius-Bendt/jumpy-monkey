# Jumpy Monkey

## Description:
Jumpy Monkey was developed in 2016.
I wanted to create a platformer with random generation, and this was the result.

This project is dead. I wont be updating or maintaining it.
The code in the project does not follow my current style of coding, or up to any standards.
the code is in other words, spaghetti code and properly filled with bugs. 

## Warning:
Some assets have been removed, and others haven't been updated. This could result in a lot of errors!
I have no idea what "EasySave" is, or how it works anymore. Sorry!


## Setup:
Either clone the reposity, or import the unity package file.<br>
The latest unity version tested: UNITY_2019.4.11f1<br>
However, newer version *should* work. 
Warning: Assets could throw a lot af errors!
